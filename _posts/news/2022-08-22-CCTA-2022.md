IEEE CCTA 2022 is happening this week in Trieste, Italy, 
and I will be the session chair for WeA7 Control Applications III (Virtual, 
Wednesday, August 24, 2022, 10:30-12:50) and will be presenting our paper 
titled "Terrain-Based Vehicle Localization Using an Active Suspension System". 
It is co-authored by my colleagues and myself in the CTO office at ClearMotion. 
This paper summarizes the novel idea of using active suspension systems to achieve 
highly accurate localization, and the key results have been patented. Please stop by 
if you are interested in our work.
