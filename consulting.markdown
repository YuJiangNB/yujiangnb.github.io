# Findop Solutions LLC #

I started my part-time consulting business (Findop Solutions LLC) in 2020. I provide technical consulting services including:

- Helping you identify the right tools from control and optimization theories for your specific engineering applications
- Prototyping control algorithms (e.g., PID, LQR, Adaptive, Robust, Learning-based) for various applications
- Reviewing control architecture and algorithms design
- Fundamentals on Simulink/Simscape modeling and model-based-design
- Literature review / patent research on autonomous driving and robotics related inventions

Note that due to my current engagement with ClearMotion, I will not be able to work on things related to **active vehicle suspension systems**
